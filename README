To run:

./Fba-tester [number of cores] [Likelihood XML] [input XML] [output directory]

Number of cores: For K-shortest parallelization. 1 means not parallel. Must be less than the number
of available cores on a single machine (OpenMP limitation).

Likelihood XML contains reaction, metabolite, likelihood information
Input XML contains media, biomass information.

For now input XML is limited to single biomass for a single media condition.

Output directory is optional. Default location is /outputs/. All information existing in
the specified output folder is removed prior to generating new results [to prevent mixing of outputs from
multiple runs].
